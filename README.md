It is said that investing in real estate come across minds of most people at some point in their lives.

When real estate investors and home buyers alike analyze potential properties to purchase, having the clear numbers in front of you can be extremely helpful in making informed decision.


Users are asked to enter three inputs:
1. Purchase price
2. Holding period in years
3. Expected annual appreciation


This calculator takes these user inputs and provides annualized year by year return on their money, as well as the total outcome of their investment at the end of holding period.
